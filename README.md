# Hi, I'm @DiogoGramunha👋

I am driven by curiosity and I desire to keep learning to have the ability to solve as many problems as possible. I am a student who dives head first into the world of Backend and Mobile Development knowledge. It is by passionately working that I try to improve all my knowledge and abilities in the world of technologies!
